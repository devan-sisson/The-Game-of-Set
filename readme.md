# The Game of Set
(WIP)

This is an update to my project [set-game](https://github.com/devan-sisson/set-game) using pngs for the buttons opposed to painted images.

From [set-game](https://github.com/devan-sisson/set-game):
> This project was one of my first projects at Salt Lake Community College. I was falling behind in my class and my professor let me make up a great deal of my work by completing this program.

The new UI uses some PNGs that I generated using a JS script and SVGs.
